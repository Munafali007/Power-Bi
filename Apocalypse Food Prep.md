# Apocalypse Food Prep - Power BI Project
This Power BI project analyzes the prices of apocalypse-related supplies at three fictitious stores in the United States. The project uses bar charts to compare prices across the different stores.

# Data Sources
The data for this project was created in Excel and includes prices for items such as canned food, water, medical supplies, and other items that might be useful in the event of an apocalypse or other disaster scenario. The data included only four columns: price, store, date, and product.

# Visualizations
Using Power BI, bar charts were created to compare prices across the three stores. The charts show the average price for each item at each store, allowing users to compare prices and identify the most cost-effective options.

# Conclusion
This Power BI project provides a simple and straightforward comparison of prices for apocalypse-related supplies at three fictitious stores in the United States. Despite having created the data in Excel, the project still effectively uses bar charts to visualize the prices across different stores. This information can be used to make informed decisions when stocking up on supplies for an apocalypse or other disaster scenario.
